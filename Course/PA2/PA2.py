INFO6205 - PA2

Subproblem Definition:
----------------------
We define a function `all_construct(target)` that returns all possible ways to construct the given
'target' string using the elements from the 'wordbank' list.

Each subproblem corresponds to a suffix of the original target string. The problem is broken down
by removing a prefix (a word from wordbank) and recursively solving for the remaining suffix.

Decisions:
----------
At each step, we iterate through the wordbank. If a word is a prefix of the current target,
we choose that word and recursively try to construct the remaining suffix. The overall
solution will be a combination of the chosen word and the solutions to the subproblem.

Recursion:
----------
all_construct(target) = [
    [word] + way
    for word in wordbank
    if target.startswith(word)
    for way in all_construct(target[len(word):])
]

Base Case:
----------
If the target is an empty string, we return `[[]]`, representing one valid way to construct nothing.
